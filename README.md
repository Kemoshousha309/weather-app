# Weather App
This is a technical task to view the current weather of a given city.

## Overview & Approach
It's very simple. write the name of the city you want then view the weather of that city. In this project I have used [Weather api](https://www.weatherapi.com). The app views the current temperature, humidly, wind and precipitation of that city.
